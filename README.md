# InventoryManagement

##1. Python solution: 
   The python solution's just an attempt at solving the problem, and I included it for completeness' sake.
   It passes the basic test cases.
   
##2. C# solution:
   1. Has full fledged tests and error handling you can step through.
   2. If you have visual studio, you can compile and run the solution and also the tests(Unit test project).
   3. The exes are generated in the bin directory. I'll attach an exe for your reference.
   4. The exe needs to be compiled like:
      PathToExe/ConsoleApplication4.exe [JsonInput]
   5. The json input needs to be of the form  : "{\"name\":\"abc\",\"place\":\"xyz\"}"
   6.  To run the tests, either use vstest.console.exe or mstest via command line.
